## 1. Business Understanding

For this project, I was interested in using Airbnb data from Berlin to answer the following questions:

1. What is the overall trend of Airbnb in Berlin for past 5 years?
2. How does neighborhood affect the price and overall rating?
3. What factors contribute to the overall price?

## 2. Data Understanding

The relevant data are accessible from Inside Airbnb (http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html).  The following files are downloaded for the analysis purpose:  
- listings.csv.gz
- calendar.csv.gz
- reviews.csv.gz
- neighbourhoods.csv
